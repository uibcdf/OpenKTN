Installation
------------

At this moment there is only a very unstable developing version. This version can be installed from the github repository as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uibcdf/OpenKTN.git
cd OpenKTN
python setup.py develop
```

There is no automatic mechanism to install the dependencies. So you have to be sure that the following packages are installed in your os or working python environment:

- Numpy   
- Pandas   
- Networks   
- Openmm
